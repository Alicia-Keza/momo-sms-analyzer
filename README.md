## The Problem

MTN MoMo users receive hundreds of SMS messages for every transaction — sending money, receiving payments, paying bills, buying airtime, and more. These messages are stored as raw XML, making it nearly impossible to search, filter, or understand your own financial history at a glance.

## Our Solution

This application provides an end-to-end pipeline that:

- **Parses** raw MoMo XML SMS exports from Android devices
- **Cleans and transforms** each message into structured transaction records
- **Categorizes** transactions (sent money, received money, merchant payments, airtime, bill payments, etc.)
- **Stores** everything in a normalized MySQL relational database (`momo_db`)
- **Exposes** data via a REST API with well-defined JSON response shapes
- **Displays** results on an interactive dashboard with charts and filterable tables

## Database Design (`momo_db`)

The database is built in **MySQL** with `utf8mb4` encoding and InnoDB engine throughout. It consists of **12 tables** organized into three layers.

### Entity Tables

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `users` | End users who own MoMo accounts |
| `agents` | MoMo agents facilitating cash-in / cash-out |
| `merchants` | Businesses accepting MoMo payments |
| `service_providers` | Utility, telco, and insurance providers billed via MoMo |
| `phone_numbers` | Polymorphic — links numbers to users or agents |
| `accounts` | MoMo accounts (personal, merchant, or agent) linked to users |

### Transaction Tables

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `sms_messages` | Raw ingested SMS messages — source of truth for all parsing |
| `transaction_categories` | Lookup table: category slug + credit/debit direction |
| `transactions` | Core transaction records linked to accounts and categories |
| `transaction_participants` | Polymorphic junction table — senders, receivers, facilitators |
| `balance_snapshots` | Account balance recorded after each transaction |

### System Table

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `system_logs` | Parse success, failure, and duplicate events for observability |

### Transaction Categories

| Category slug | Direction | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `send_money` | debit | Transfer to another user |
| `merchant_payment` | debit | Payment to a shop / merchant |
| `airtime_purchase` | debit | Airtime top-up |
| `bill_payment` | debit | Utility / insurance / telco bill |
| `receive_money` | credit | Inbound transfer |
| `cash_in` | credit | Deposit via agent |
| `cash_out` | debit | Withdrawal via agent |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Polymorphic FKs** — `phone_numbers.owner_id` and `transaction_participants.party_id` resolve to different entity tables depending on their `owner_type` / `party_type` discriminator columns.
- **Balance snapshots** — every completed transaction stores the resulting account balance for auditing and charting.
- **System logs** — every SMS parse attempt (success, failure, or duplicate) is recorded for debugging and monitoring.
- **Source traceability** — every transaction links back to the raw SMS it was parsed from via `source_sms_id`.

### Relationships & Cardinality

| Relationship | Cardinality | Foreign Key | On Delete | On Update |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `users` → `accounts` | 1 : M | `accounts.user_id` | RESTRICT | CASCADE |
| `accounts` → `transactions` | 1 : M | `transactions.account_id` | RESTRICT | CASCADE |
| `transaction_categories` → `transactions` | 1 : M | `transactions.category_id` | RESTRICT | CASCADE |
| `sms_messages` → `transactions` | 1 : 0..1 | `transactions.source_sms_id` | SET NULL | CASCADE |
| `transactions` → `transaction_participants` | 1 : M | `transaction_participants.transaction_id` | CASCADE | CASCADE |
| `transactions` → `balance_snapshots` | 1 : 1 | `balance_snapshots.transaction_id` | CASCADE | CASCADE |
| `accounts` → `balance_snapshots` | 1 : M | `balance_snapshots.account_id` | CASCADE | CASCADE |
| `sms_messages` → `system_logs` | 1 : M (nullable) | `system_logs.sms_id` | SET NULL | CASCADE |
| `transactions` → `system_logs` | 1 : M (nullable) | `system_logs.transaction_id` | SET NULL | CASCADE |
| `users` / `agents` → `phone_numbers` | 1 : M (polymorphic) | `phone_numbers.owner_id` + `owner_type` | — | — |
| `users` / `agents` / `merchants` / `service_providers` → `transaction_participants` | M : N (polymorphic) | `transaction_participants.party_id` + `party_type` | — | — |

**Notes:**

- `users → accounts` is **1:M** — one user can hold multiple accounts (personal, merchant, agent), but every account belongs to exactly one user.
- `accounts → transactions` is **1:M** — one account has many transactions; every transaction is tied to exactly one account.
- `sms_messages → transactions` is **1:0..1** — one SMS produces at most one transaction. The FK is nullable (`source_sms_id` can be `NULL`) to allow manually inserted transactions with no source SMS.
- `transactions → transaction_participants` is **1:M** — one transaction has multiple participants (e.g. a sender and a receiver). The junction table resolves the M:N relationship between transactions and any entity type (user, agent, merchant, provider).
- `transactions → balance_snapshots` is effectively **1:1** — one snapshot is recorded per transaction per account, capturing the balance immediately after.
- `system_logs` FKs to both `sms_messages` and `transactions` are **nullable** — a log entry may relate to a failed SMS parse (no transaction yet) or to a transaction with no linked SMS.
- **Polymorphic relationships** (`phone_numbers`, `transaction_participants`) use a discriminator column (`owner_type`, `party_type`) to identify which table `owner_id` / `party_id` points to. MySQL cannot enforce these with standard FKs; resolution is handled at the application layer.
- All standard FKs use `ON UPDATE CASCADE` so that primary key changes propagate automatically, and either `ON DELETE RESTRICT` (to protect financial records) or `ON DELETE CASCADE` / `SET NULL` where child rows are safe to remove or orphan.

## Indexes & Constraints

### Indexes

| Index | Table | Columns | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `idx_transactions_date` | `transactions` | `transaction_date` | Date-range queries and sorting |
| `idx_transactions_status` | `transactions` | `status` | Filter by pending / completed / failed |
| `idx_transactions_status_date` | `transactions` | `status, transaction_date` | Combined status + date filters (e.g. failed in last 7 days) |
| `idx_participants_party` | `transaction_participants` | `party_type, party_id` | Fast participant lookups |
| `idx_phones_owner` | `phone_numbers` | `owner_type, owner_id` | Phone-to-owner resolution |
| `idx_sms_received` | `sms_messages` | `received_epoch_ms` | Chronological SMS ordering |
| `idx_sms_address` | `sms_messages` | `address` | Filter by SMS sender |
| `idx_logs_created` | `system_logs` | `created_at` | Log timeline queries |
| `idx_logs_event` | `system_logs` | `event_type` | Filter by event type |
| `idx_snapshots_at` | `balance_snapshots` | `snapshot_at` | Balance history lookups |

### Uniqueness Constraints

| Constraint | Table | Column | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `uq_account_number` | `accounts` | `account_number` | No duplicate account numbers |
| `uq_agent_code` | `agents` | `agent_code` | Each agent code is unique |
| `uq_shop_code` | `merchants` | `shop_code` | Each merchant shop code is unique |
| `uq_provider_name` | `service_providers` | `provider_name` | Prevents ambiguous joins on provider name |
| `uq_category_name` | `transaction_categories` | `name` | One row per category slug |
| `uq_external_tx_id` | `transactions` | `external_tx_id` | Prevents duplicate transaction ingestion |
| `uq_msisdn` | `phone_numbers` | `msisdn` | Each phone number registered once |

### Format & Business Rule Checks

| Constraint | Rule |
|---|---|
| `chk_msisdn_format` | Phone numbers must match `^250[0-9]{9}$` (Rwandan format) |
| `chk_account_number_format` | Account numbers must be exactly 8 digits |
| `chk_external_tx_id_format` | Must match `TXNxxxxxxx` or numeric format |
| `chk_transactions_amount` | Transaction amount must be `> 0` |
| `chk_transactions_amount_max` | Transaction amount must be `<= 10,000,000 RWF` |
| `chk_transactions_fee` | Fee must be `>= 0` |
| `chk_snapshots_balance` | Balance after transaction must be `>= 0` |
| `chk_accounts_closed_at` | `closed_at` must be after `opened_at` |

---

## CRUD Queries & Views

Implemented in `database/queries.sql` with result screenshots in `docs/screenshots/`.

### Read Queries

| Query | Description |
|---|---|
| Q001 | All transactions for a single user, joined through their account |
| Q002 | Count and total value of transactions per category |
| Q003 | All failed transactions with full owner and SMS context |
| Q004 | Top 5 users by total completed transaction volume |
| Q005 | Every party (sender, receiver, facilitator) in a specific transaction |

### Write Queries

| Query | Description |
|---|---|
| Q006 | Insert a new pending transaction |
| Q007 | Update a pending transaction to completed |
| Q008 | Bulk-close an account (set status + `closed_at`) |
| Q009 | Delete a system log row |

### View: `full_transaction_details`

A convenience view joining `transactions`, `accounts`, `users`, `transaction_categories`, and `sms_messages` into a single flat result set. Includes a computed `total_debited_rwf = amount + fee_amount` column.

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `transaction_id`, `external_tx_id` | `transactions` |
| `account_owner` | `users.full_name` |
| `account_number`, `wallet_provider` | `accounts` |
| `category`, `money_direction` | `transaction_categories` |
| `amount`, `fee_amount`, `total_debited_rwf` | `transactions` (last computed) |
| `status`, `transaction_date` | `transactions` |
| `sms_sender`, `source_sms_body` | `sms_messages` |

---

## JSON API Schemas

Defined in `examples/json_schemas.json` with a full mapping guide in `examples/json_mapping.md`.

### Global Conventions

| SQL Type | JSON Representation |
|---|---|
| `INT`, `BIGINT` | JSON number (integer) |
| `DECIMAL(15,2)` | JSON number with 2 decimal places (e.g. `5000.00`) |
| `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`, `CHAR` | JSON string |
| `TIMESTAMP` | ISO 8601 UTC string with `Z` suffix (e.g. `"2024-01-25T10:00:00Z"`) |
| `ENUM` | JSON string using the database value verbatim |
| `NULL` | JSON `null` |

### Flat vs. Nested Responses

- **Flat** — one row per entity, foreign keys as bare integers.
- **Nested** — foreign keys replaced with fully embedded objects, requiring only one API round-trip. Polymorphic FKs (`owner_id`, `party_id`) always resolve to a typed nested object.
- **Computed fields** — `total_debited` (`amount + fee_amount`) appears only in nested responses.

### Complex Transaction Object

For full transaction details the API returns a deeply nested object embedding:

- `source_sms` — the raw SMS that was parsed
- `account` + `account.owner` — the account and its user
- `category` — transaction category and direction
- `participants[]` — each party with their full entity (user, merchant, agent, or provider) and phone number
- `balance_snapshot` — balance recorded after the transaction
- `system_logs[]` — all parse events linked to this transaction

### Example Transactions

**Send Money**
```
Alice Uwimana (250788123456)
  → sends 5,000 RWF + 50 RWF fee
  → to Jean Pierre Habimana (250788234567)
  → new balance: 45,000 RWF  |  TXN20240125001
```

**Merchant Payment**
```
Diane Iribagiza (250722789012)
  → pays 3,500 RWF (no fee)
  → to Simba Supermarket (SHOP-1001)
  → new balance: 24,000 RWF  |  TXN20240125005
```
